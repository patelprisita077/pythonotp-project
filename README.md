This Python project implements a secure email-based password verification system. Upon entering their email, users receive a 6-digit password sent directly to their email address. The system allows users up to three attempts to enter the correct password. If the password is entered incorrectly four times, access is denied. This project showcases robust error handling and user authentication processes, emphasizing security and user experience.

Key Features:

Email Integration: Automatically sends a 6-digit password to the user's email.
User Authentication: Users have three chances to enter the correct password.
